# minesweeper-API
API test

This game was built using java as backend and reactjs to built the client.

The api documentacion can be found here: https://minesweeper-api-java.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html#/app-controller
The client to play the game is here: https://minesweeper-app-client.herokuapp.com/

It is a basic game. The user history is taken just by user game. I did not want to take time building a whole login module so I based the history by user name.

You can pause and resume the game paused.
